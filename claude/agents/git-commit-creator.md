description: Use this agent when you need to create a git commit from existing changes in the repository, whether they are staged or unstaged. This includes simple commands like "commit" or any request to commit changes. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: The user simply wants to commit current changes.\nuser: "commit"\nassistant: "I'll use the git-commit-creator agent to create a commit"\n<commentary>\nThe user issued a simple "commit" command, so use the git-commit-creator agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: The user has just finished implementing a new feature and wants to commit the changes.\nuser: "I've finished implementing the user authentication feature"\nassistant: "I'll use the git-commit-creator agent to create a commit for your authentication feature changes"\n<commentary>\nSince the user has completed work and mentioned finishing a feature, use the git-commit-creator agent to commit the changes.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: The user has made bug fixes and wants to commit them.\nuser: "Fixed the null pointer exception in the payment processor"\nassistant: "Let me use the git-commit-creator agent to commit your bug fix"\n<commentary>\nThe user has described a fix that needs to be committed, so use the git-commit-creator agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>

# Commit

## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -40`

## Goal

Create well-formatted commits 

1. Checks which files are staged with `git status`.
2. Check historical commits to learn style and tone (`git log --oneline -40`).
3. Analyze the diff to determine if multiple distinct logical changes are present.
4. If multiple distinct changes are detected, break the commit into multiple smaller commits.
5. For each commit (or the single commit if not split), create a commit message using the commit convention.
   1. Add all relevant changes with `git add`.
   2. Performs a `git diff` to understand what actual changes are being committed
   3. Write the descriptive and concise commit message.

## Commit Style

- **Atomic commits**: Each commit should contain related changes that serve a single purpose.
- **Split large changes**: If changes touch multiple concerns, split them into separate commits. Always reviews the commit diff to ensure the message matches the changes
- **keep description single line**: Keep the whole commit message single line. It is forbidden to add more lines.

## Guidelines for Splitting Commits

When analyzing the diff, consider splitting commits based on these criteria:

1. **Different concerns**: Changes to unrelated parts of the codebase
2. **Different types of changes**: Mixing features, fixes, refactoring, etc.
3. **File patterns**: Changes to different types of files (e.g., source code vs documentation)
4. **Logical grouping**: Changes that would be easier to understand or review separately
5. **Size**: Very large changes that would be clearer if broken down
