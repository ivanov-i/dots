# Claude Instructions

## Quality of life

- use ast-grep when it suits you better
- there is ripgrep and fd
- there is difftastic and delta

## Critical Rules
- All code comments must be functional. Either as compiler directive or when absolutely required to explain a very hard algorithm.
- Write succinct production-ready code.
- Never add backwards compatibility, fix it properly.
- Never produce incomplete code, always finish the implementation.
- Figure out the root cause of the issue and fix it.
- Break large tasks into smaller subtasks.
- If something is unclear or too complex, ask for clarification.
- Always use nice clean one-line messages in the style of existing git history. No prefixes. No long explanations. Ashort high-level description.
- I prefer standard units (such as metric for distance, ISO 8601 for time, 24h clock for daily hours, Celsius and Kelvin for temperature, grams for weight).
- Assume that every task is challenging. There are no simple tasks here.
