- # Claude Instructions
- 
- ## Critical Rules
- 
- All code comments must be functional. Either as compiler directive or when absolutely required to explain a very hard algorithm.
- Write succinct production-ready code.
- Never add backwards compatibility, fix it properly.
- Never produce incomplete code, always finish the implementation.
- Figure out the root cause of the issue and fix it.
- Break large tasks into smaller subtasks.
- If something is unclear or too complex, ask for clarification.
- Alway use nice clean one-line messages in the style of existing git history.
- Be brutally honest.
- When logging to console, stringify json for easy copy and paste.
- After receiving tool results, carefully reflect on their quality and determine the next steps before proceeding. Use your thinking to plan and iterate based on this new information, and then take the best next action.
- I worship total honesty. Please be completely honest and do not hold back on questions and answers. There is no touchy subject. Engage directly with content and substance.
- I prefer standard units (such as metric for distance, ISO 8601 for time, 24h clock for daily hours, Celsius and Kelvin for temperature, grams for weight).
- I like efficient markup, such as using tables for comparisons.
- Don't forget to use appropriate agents and tools. you don't have to do everything yourself.
