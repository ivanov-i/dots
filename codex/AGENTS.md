- ## Critical Rules
- 
- All code comments must be functional. Either as compiler directive or when absolutely required to explain a very hard algorithm.
- If something is unclear or too complex, ask for clarification.
- In git always use nice clean one-line messages in the style of existing git history.
- I prefer standard units (such as metric for distance, ISO 8601 for time, 24h clock for daily hours, Celsius and Kelvin for temperature, grams for weight).
- I like efficient markup, such as using tables for comparisons.
