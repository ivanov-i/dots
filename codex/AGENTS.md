# Instructions

## Quality of life

- use ast-grep when it suits you better
- there us ripgrep and fd
- there is difftastic and delta

## Critical Rules

- All code comments must be functional. Either as compiler directive or when absolutely required to explain a very hard algorithm.
- It is absolutely forbidden to add code comments when it is not required.
- Instead of comments use short but descriptive variable or method or class names etc. 
- Keep files reasonably short when possible.
- If something is unclear or too complex, ask for clarification.
- In git always use nice clean one-line messages in the style of existing git history. no prefixes
- Never do anything with remote in git. Only local. no fetches or pushes.
- I prefer standard units (such as metric for distance, ISO 8601 for time, 24h clock for daily hours, Celsius and Kelvin for temperature, grams for weight).
- I like efficient markup, such as using tables for comparisons.
- When asked a question provide an answer. Do not do anything else.
- When workin on a plan with steps do them without skipping.
- If there are checkboxes in the plan, mark them as done after each step.
- If you need to run a python script, use uv to avoid modules instantiation.
