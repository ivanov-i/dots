# Implementing Plans

## Overview
Execute the plan sequentially without skipping or batching. Keep docs and the plan in sync as you go.

## When to Use
- When implementing a written plan.

## Execution Checklist
1. ☐ Read plan and referenced docs fully
2. ☐ Sanity check: discrepancies, missing tasks/docs, optional/NOP steps → pause and clarify
3. ☐ Select next task in order; implement it
4. ☐ Update docs as needed
5. ☐ Update plan checkboxes responsibly
6. ☐ Commit with the plan’s specified message
7. ☐ Proceed to next task; avoid batching

## Anti‑Patterns
- Doing tasks out of order or in batches
- Skipping plan steps, modifying plan/docs without permission

## Response Pattern
1) If ambiguous → clarify
2) If clear → implement strictly per plan
3) Cite rules used (context-first, sanity‑check, sequential execution)
