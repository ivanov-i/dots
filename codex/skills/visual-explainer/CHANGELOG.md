# Changelog

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-25

### Slide Deck Mode
- New output format: magazine-quality slide deck presentations as self-contained HTML files
- 10 slide types: Title, Section Divider, Content, Split, Diagram, Dashboard, Table, Code, Quote, Full-Bleed
- SlideEngine JS: keyboard/touch/wheel navigation, progress bar, nav dots, slide counter, keyboard hints with auto-fade
- Cinematic transitions: fade + translateY + scale on slide entrance, staggered child reveals via IntersectionObserver
- 4 curated presets: Midnight Editorial, Warm Signal, Terminal Mono, Swiss Clean (each with full light/dark palette)
- Event delegation: Mermaid zoom, scrollable code/tables don't trigger slide navigation
- Responsive height breakpoints (700px, 600px, 500px) for projection and small viewports
- Typography scale 2–3× larger than scrollable pages (80–120px display, 28–48px headings, 16–24px body)
- Per-slide background variation, SVG decorative accents, compositional variety rules
- Proactive imagery: surf-cli integration for title/full-bleed backgrounds, inline sparklines, mini-charts
- New `/generate-slides` prompt template; existing prompts support `--slides` flag via SKILL.md workflow
- Unified `autoFit()` post-render function: auto-scales Mermaid SVGs, KPI values, and long blockquotes to fit their containers
- Fix Mermaid diagrams rendering tiny in slide containers (flex shrink-wrap + inline max-width)
- Fix KPI card overflow for text values (white-space + transform scale)
- Fix quote slides with long text (proportional font-size reduction)

### Files
- `references/slide-patterns.md` — slide engine CSS, all 10 type layouts, transitions, nav chrome, content density limits, presets
- `templates/slide-deck.html` — reference template demonstrating all 10 types in Midnight Editorial preset
- `prompts/generate-slides.md` — slash command for generating slide decks
- `SKILL.md` — new "Slide Deck Mode" section with slide routing, `--slides` flag detection, visual richness guidance

## [0.1.4] - 2026-02-24

- Removed Mermaid `handDrawn` mode — Rough.js hachure fills are hardcoded and render unreadable diagonal scribbles inside nodes with no user-facing override. All diagrams now use `look: 'classic'` with custom `themeVariables` for visual distinction.
- Added `package.json` for `pi install` support — installs the skill and all slash commands in one step instead of `git clone` + manual `cp`

## [0.1.3] - 2026-02-24

- Extended `classDef` color warning to also cover per-node `style` directives — both hardcode text color that breaks in the opposite color scheme
- Renamed `.node` card classes to `.ve-card` to fix CSS collision with Mermaid's internal `.node` class that broke diagram layout (PR #7)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-02-19

- Added sequence diagram syntax guidance to "Writing Valid Mermaid" — curly braces, brackets, and ampersands in message labels silently break rendering

## [0.1.1] - 2026-02-19

- Prompts no longer require the `pi-prompt-template-model` extension — each prompt now explicitly loads the skill itself
- Added "Writing Valid Mermaid" section to `libraries.md` (quoting special chars, simple IDs, max node count, arrow styles, pipe escaping)
- Fixed mobile scroll offset in `responsive-nav.md` — section headings now clear the sticky nav bar via `scroll-margin-top`
- Added video preview to README

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-16

Initial release.

### Skill
- Core workflow: Think (pick aesthetic) → Structure (read template) → Style (apply design) → Deliver (write + open)
- 11 diagram types with rendering approach routing (Mermaid, CSS Grid, HTML tables, Chart.js)
- 9 aesthetic directions (monochrome terminal, editorial, blueprint, neon, paper/ink, sketch, IDE-inspired, data-dense, gradient mesh)
- Mermaid deep theming with `theme: 'base'` + `themeVariables`, hand-drawn mode, ELK layout
- Zoom controls (buttons, scroll-to-zoom, drag-to-pan) required on all Mermaid containers
- Proactive table rendering — agent generates HTML instead of ASCII for complex tables
- Optional AI-generated illustrations via surf-cli + Gemini Nano Banana Pro
- Both light and dark themes via CSS custom properties and `prefers-color-scheme`
- Quality checks: squint test, swap test, overflow protection, zoom controls verification

### References
- `css-patterns.md` — theme setup, depth tiers, node cards, grid layouts, data tables, status badges, KPI cards, before/after panels, connectors, animations (fadeUp, fadeScale, drawIn, countUp), collapsible sections, overflow protection, generated image containers
- `libraries.md` — Mermaid (CDN, ELK, deep theming, hand-drawn mode, CSS overrides, diagram examples), Chart.js, anime.js, Google Fonts with 13 font pairings
- `responsive-nav.md` — sticky sidebar TOC on desktop, horizontal scrollable bar on mobile, scroll spy

### Templates
- `architecture.html` — CSS Grid card layout, terracotta/sage palette, depth tiers, flow arrows, pipeline with parallel branches
- `mermaid-flowchart.html` — Mermaid flowchart with ELK + handDrawn mode, teal/cyan palette, zoom controls
- `data-table.html` — HTML table with KPI cards, status badges, collapsible details, rose/cranberry palette

### Prompt Templates
- `/generate-web-diagram` — generate a diagram for any topic
- `/diff-review` — visual diff review with architecture comparison, KPI dashboard, code review, decision log
- `/plan-review` — plan vs. codebase with current/planned architecture, risk assessment, understanding gaps
- `/project-recap` — project mental model snapshot for context-switching
- `/fact-check` — verify factual accuracy of review pages and plan docs against actual code
