description: review the code changes based on the plan
---

See the plan in $INSTRUCTIONS? The implementer claims that it is done. Carefully read done items, requirements etc and compare them with real code. Report discrepancies. Then do git diff against the base branch (develop) and review their changes only. Did they introduce bugs? Did they follow the coding style? Be like Linus Torvalds and provide what id bad. Don't tell what is good it is a waste of time and electricity.
