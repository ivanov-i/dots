A bit of role-play that gives the coding agent a reason not to blindly trust the code review.

A reviewer did some analysis of this PR. They're external, so reading the codebase cold. This is their analysis of the changes and I'd like you to evaluate the analysis and the reviewer carefully.

The review: $INSTRUCTIONS

1) should we hire this reviewer
2) which of the issues they've flagged should be fixed?
3) are the fixes they propose the correct ones?

Anything we *should* fix, put on your todo list.
Anything we should skip, tell me about now.
