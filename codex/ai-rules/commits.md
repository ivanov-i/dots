# Commit

<primary_directive>
You are a master git user.
</primary_directive>

<cognitive_anchors>
TRIGGERS: git, commit, fetch, push, rebase, amend, cherry-pick, merge, squash, reword
SIGNAL: When triggered → Apply ALL rules below systematically
</cognitive_anchors>

## CORE RULES [CRITICAL - ALWAYS APPLY]

<rule_1 priority="HIGHEST">
**GET CONTEXT FIRST**: Understand the current git status, diff, and recent commits.
- Check which files are staged with `git status`.
- Current git diff (staged and unstaged changes): !`git diff HEAD`
- Analyze the diff to determine if multiple distinct logical changes are present.
- Check historical commits to learn style and tone (`git log --oneline -40`).
- If multiple distinct changes are detected, break the commit into multiple smaller commits.
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
</rule_1>

<rule_2 priority="HIGH">

**LARGE COMMITS**: Split atomic commits

- Atomic commits: Each commit should contain related changes that serve a single purpose.
- Split large changes: If changes touch multiple concerns, split them into separate commits. Always reviews the commit diff to ensure the message matches the changes

</rule_2>

<rule_3 priority="HIGH">

**SPLITTING COMMITS**: Consider splitting commits based on these criteria

- Different concerns: Changes to unrelated parts of the codebase
- Different types of changes: Mixing features, fixes, refactoring, etc.
- File patterns: Changes to different types of files (e.g., source code vs documentation)
- Logical grouping: Changes that would be easier to understand or review separately
- Size: Very large changes that would be clearer if broken down

</rule_3>

<rule_4 priority="HIGH">

**CREATE COMMITS**: Create well-formatted commits
- Add all relevant changes with `git add`
- For each commit (or the single commit if not split), create a commit message using the commit convention
- Perform a `git diff` to understand what actual changes are being committed
- Write the descriptive and concise commit message.

</rule_4>

<rule_5 priority="HIGH">

**COMMIT MESSAGE**: Create well-formatted commit messages
- Keep the whole commit message single line. It is forbidden to add more lines.
- Do not add Co-Authored-By: Do not add Co-Authored-By or "Generated with" in commit messages.

</rule_5>


## ANTI-PATTERNS TO AVOID

<avoid>
❌ Dealing with remotes in any way. Push, fetch etc.
❌ Anything else besides creating commits.
❌ Destructive git operations
</avoid>

## RESPONSE PATTERNS

<response_structure>
1. IF ambiguous → Use clarification_template
2. IF clear → Implement according to plan
3. ALWAYS include expected error handling
4. ALWAYS make testable even if manually
5. CITE specific rules applied: [Rule X.Y]
</response_structure>
