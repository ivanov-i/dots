## How to Use
- Run `oracle --help` once to learn the interface syntax
- By default it uses browser engine and profile set up elsewhere. This is correct, do not modify.
- If it can't login, do not try to fix it. Ask the user to help you.
- Note, only browser engine works. Do not try other engines.
- Use good prompt and provide all needed context in prompt and files.
- Do not supply the answers, do not nudge it into your direction

## Anti‑Patterns
- using any other engine
- not stoppying and not reporting errors
- "I've already solved this, and here's my reasons why it's solved, but check it over anyway," kind of tone, which heavily biases Oracle
